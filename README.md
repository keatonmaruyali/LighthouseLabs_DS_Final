## About The Project
Final project for LighthouseLabs Data Science Bootcamp. The goal of the project is to use historical stock data in conjunction with sentiment analysis of news headlines and Twitter posts, to predict the future price of a stock of interest. The headlines were obtained by scraping the website, FinViz, while tweets were taken using Tweepy. Both were analyzed using the Vader Sentiment Analyzer.
